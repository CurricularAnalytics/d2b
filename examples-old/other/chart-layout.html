<b>X-Year Program-Admitted graduation rate</b> — the X-year graduation rate for those students accepted to \
a specified major within X years of their initial enrollment at UNM. This rate, generally reported as \
a percentage, is the quotient with divisor given by the total number of students admitted to a major \
within X years, and dividend given by the number of these students who graduated with a bachelor’s \
degree in that program within X years. \
<br /><br />\
<b>Notes:</b>\
<ul>\
<li>Students admitted to a program after the target year are not included in the rate computation. \
E.g., a student admitted to a program during their fifth year would not be counted in the four-year \
program-accepted graduation rate for that program.</li>\
\
<li>If a student is admitted to more than one program, e.g., as a result of changing majors, the \
student will count as program-accepted in each of the programs to which he or she was admitted.</li> \
\
<li>If a student is admitted to the same program multiple times as a result of multiple major changes, \
the student will count as being admitted to the program once—at the time of the earliest admittance.</li> \
\
<li>A college’s X-year program-accepted graduation rate is computing by considering all of the program \
admittances that occurred in the college within X years  (the divisor), and then the number of these \
admitted students who went on to graduate with a bachelor’s degree, from any program in the college, \
within X years (the dividend).</li></ul>\

<b>X-Year Program-Intended graduation rate</b> — of those students who initially declared a major and \
who graduated in X years from a given cohort, the percentage who did so in the initially intended major \
they originally chose.\

<b>Notes:</b>\
<ul>\
<li>Students who were initially undecided, who stopped out, or who did not graduate within X years will not be included in this statistic.</li></ul>\
